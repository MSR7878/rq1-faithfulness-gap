# RQ1 Metric Spec (locked) -- mirrors RQ1_Metric_Spec.docx v4

Datasets: MUTAG (standard), MUTAG (GraphXAI GT-labeled), BBBP, Tox21 (SR-p53
phase 1, then all 12 endpoints), B-XAIC (task "indole" for phase 2 -- explicit
starting choice, mirroring SR-p53 for Tox21; other B-XAIC tasks deferred)
Explainers: GNNExplainer, PGExplainer, SubgraphX
Base model: PyG-native D-MPNN (Yang et al. 2019 architecture -- directed edge
message passing), implemented in src/train/dmpnn.py with a
`model(x, edge_index, edge_attr, batch)` forward so it drops straight into the
metrics harness and the Phase-3 explainers. Chemprop is NOT a required runtime
dependency (v3 named "D-MPNN (Chemprop)"; changed in v4). Chemprop may still be
installed informally as an optional accuracy cross-check.

## Metrics (verified against GraphXAI source, graphxai/metrics/metrics_graph.py)

- Fid+  = (1/N) sum_i [ f(G_i)_yi - f(G_i \ E_i)_yi ]
- Fid-  = (1/N) sum_i [ f(G_i)_yi - f(E_i)_yi ]
- GEF   = 1 - exp( -KL( f(G_i) || f(E_i) ) )        # bounded [0,1), lower = more faithful
- GEA   = JAC(M_gt, M_pr) = TP / (TP+FP+FN)          # only where ground truth exists

## Masking references -- build order R3 -> R2 -> R1

- R3 (build first): distribution-aware, replace masked features with training-set
  per-feature mean. Implemented: src/metrics/masking.py::mask_r3_distribution_aware
- R2 (build second): zero-fill, topology kept. STUB, not yet implemented.
- R1 (build third): hard removal, topology broken. STUB, not yet implemented.

## GEA applicability (ground truth required)

| Dataset                     | GEA |
|------------------------------|-----|
| MUTAG (standard)             | No  |
| MUTAG (GraphXAI GT-labeled)  | Yes |
| BBBP                         | No  |
| Tox21                        | No  |
| B-XAIC                       | Yes |

## Phase 2 status (dataset + base-model bring-up)

Datasets: all five variants load and pass `src/data/sanity_check.py`.
- MUTAG (std)      188 graphs, 7 node / 4 edge feats, 66.5% positive
- MUTAG (GraphXAI) 188 graphs, + node/edge GT: 272 NO2 + 19 NH2 motifs,
                   every flagged component verified as exactly {N,O,O} or {N}
- BBBP             2039 graphs, 9 / 3 feats, 76.5% positive
- Tox21 (SR-p53)   6750 graphs (dropped 19 empty + 1054 unlabeled), 6.3% positive
- B-XAIC (indole)  50000 graphs, 11 / 1 feats, 36.8% positive, + node/edge GT

Base model: PyG-native D-MPNN (hidden 300 / depth 3; hidden 256 for B-XAIC).
10-fold stratified CV, best checkpoint per fold selected on val(AUROC + acc)
with a short warmup guard. B-XAIC uses its shipped train/valid/test split
(40k/5k/5k) -- 10-fold on 50k graphs is neither tractable here nor standard
for that dataset. Reporting accuracy AND AUROC because class balance spans
6.3%-76.5%; AUROC is the cross-dataset-comparable number.

Compute: RTX 3050 Ti Laptop (4 GB), torch 2.14.0+cu130. All five re-run on
GPU for a device-consistent table; the earlier CPU run of MUTAG /
MUTAG-GraphXAI agreed within fold noise (0.873/0.945 vs 0.878/0.938).

| Dataset          | Protocol     | Test accuracy    | Test AUROC       | Status |
|------------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| MUTAG (std)      | 10-fold CV   | 0.878 +/- 0.071  | 0.938 +/- 0.041  | PASS -- acc & AUROC in published GNN range |
| MUTAG (GraphXAI) | 10-fold CV   | 0.884 +/- 0.057  | 0.943 +/- 0.041  | PASS -- == MUTAG (std) up to checkpoint-selection noise |
| BBBP             | 10-fold CV   | 0.877 +/- 0.025  | 0.900 +/- 0.035  | PASS -- AUROC in random-split range ~0.88-0.92 |
| Tox21 (SR-p53)   | 10-fold CV   | 0.939 +/- 0.005  | 0.827 +/- 0.050  | PASS -- AUROC in per-endpoint range ~0.80-0.86; acc ~= majority (expected at 6.3% prevalence), AUROC confirms real ranking. Multi-task (12-endpoint) training would likely lift this. |
| B-XAIC (indole)  | native split | 0.9988           | 1.0000           | PASS -- by design: exact learnable substructure rule; a near-perfect model is the premise of the benchmark |

No result outside its expected range; nothing flagged for debug.

R2/R1 masking references remain STUBBED (NotImplementedError) until R3 is
validated end-to-end across all five variants -- per the locked build order.
Explainers (Phase 3) not started.
